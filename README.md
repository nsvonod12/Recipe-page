## My process
It was fantastic, I really enjoyed it and I learned how to use Tailwind CSS better.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- NPM

### What I learned
I've already used Tailwinds CSS in other projects and I really like it. It's very easy to use and customizable.

### Continued development
I think that Animations will be the next step to make better projects.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me for documentation in TailwindCSS.
